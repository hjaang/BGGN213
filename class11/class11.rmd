```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
round(sum(db$X.ray)/sum(db$Total)*100, 2)
```

How about doing this over every method (i.e. coln in the little table)

```{r}
round(colSums(db)/sum(db$Total)*100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(db$Total[1]/sum(db$Total)*100, 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

22824 structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

Make a little movie (trajectory) for viewing in VMD.
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
